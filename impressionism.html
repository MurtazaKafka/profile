        <h1>Post-Impressionism; Art Gone Wild</h1>
        <div>
            <p>In our last lecture, we talked about the period of art called
                “impressionism.” Remember that impressionism was a very exciting
                time in the history of art. Impressionism lasted from about 1860
                until 1880. The period of time that followed impressionism is also
                very important. This period is called “post-impressionism.” The
                period of post-impressionism lasted from the late 19th century until
                the early part of the 20th century; that is, from about 1880 until
                1900.</p>
            <p>The artists of the time of post-impressionism used the previous
                form of impressionism as their basis. As you probably remember
                from our lecture on impressionism, it was common to apply paint
                thickly. Painters also painted real subject matter, like people or
                scenery. Although the post-impressionists continued to paint
                thickly and paint real subjects, they went beyond this style. For
                example, post-impressionist artists tried to show more emotion
                in their works. The artists would show extra emotion and expression
                in the faces of their subjects. They tried to show if a person looked
                sad, happy, angry, frustrated....well, you get the idea: more
                emotion.</p>
            <p>You may have heard of one of the groups that started the postimpressionist
                style. There was a group of artists who called
                themselves The Nabis. The word “nabi” is from the Hebrew
                language. Nabi means “prophet.” So, their name would translate
                to The Prophets. This small group of artists lived in Paris, France.
                They were a rebellious group of artists. They often met to discuss and
                create new styles and designs. The Nabis received a lot of attention
                since their style was so different. The fact that they painted and
                created differently than previous artists made the Nabis a famous
                group. They helped define the post-impressionist art style.</p>
            <p>The Nabis were recognized for making different kinds of art. In
                addition to painting, the Nabis did print-making. Print making
                is like what we see in posters today. Print making became very
                popular because posters could be reproduced quickly and cheaply.
                The Nabis were also interested in illustrating books and working
                with textiles and furniture. Actually, this leads me to the main
                point of today’s lecture, the goal of post-impressionist art.</p>
            <p>One of the goals of the post-impressionists was to integrate art
                with daily life. In this way, artists of this time did more than
                paint. They used other means of creating art. For example, the
                artists would not only use brushes to create a work of art. They
                would also use elements of daily life, such as glass or iron. The
                use of these materials gave their works a new look and also
                made them relevant to a far wider audience.</p>
            <p>The art of this time also went beyond simple viewing. Artists again
                integrated their work with daily life by making jewelry. In this
                sense, art could be worn by people. The artists also incorporated
                their work in architecture. The post-impressionistic designs were
                used when creating or designing buildings. The designs were also
                used when making furniture or other household objects. Again,
                they wanted to be more inclusive and appeal to a wider audience.</p>
