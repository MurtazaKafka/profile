        <h1>A Man of Constant Sorrow</h1>
        <p>
            Sometimes it’s hard to put up with one’s fellow men. Specially, if one is seeking solitude. 
            But the tragic part of the story is no matter how hard one tries to get away one will always 
            end up in an unwanted fellowship’s claw. That’s what just happened to me yesterday.
        </p>
        <p>
            Yesterday afternoon I was listening to The Beatles’ Yesterday song that my phone rang. 
            It was a call from Abuzar –my classmate. I find it hard what to name our relationship
             –friends or acquaintances? He has mocked me a dozen of times in the class. I literally
              hate speaking to him, though I answered the phone and heard his disgusting voice from 
              the other side, “Hey Murtaz. Howdy?” “Not bad. How ‘bout you?” He ignored my question 
              and said “Can you be in Tank-e-Tel in half an hour?” “Sure. But what’s it about?” “Bye.
               See you there.” The call ended. I let out a huge sigh.
        </p>
        <p>
            Twenty minutes later I was in Tank-e-Tel station. I waited another twenty minutes for
             Abuzar to arrive. In the meantime I was watching swallows, pigeons, sparrows and any 
             other bird that can be seen in the smoky sky of Kabul. Then Abuzar showed up with another
              friend of him. “Hey Murtaz.” Abuzar said. “Hey.” “Do you know Ali? He’s a painter and plays
               guitar, too. Such a gifted artist. Don’t you think?” “Nice to meet you Ali. But Abuzar, 
               why did you call me?” “Let’s go to the café. I’ll tell you there.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “I was bored.” Abuzar said while we were in Khayyam café sipping tea and listening to Beethoven. 
            “That’s why I called you. Anyway, you’re just a superfluous boy like me. Even worse, you’re not 
            liked by many girls –any girl, to tell the truth.” “Why didn’t you tell me you had nothing to 
            do with me at first? Didn’t you think I have some important stuff to deal with?” “Important stuff? 
            Like what?” “School final exam.” He laughed… Like really laughed. I couldn’t stand it. I said a 
            word that’s not expected of a polite boy and left the café. While leaving I could hear Abuzar 
            shouting on my back “Hey Murtaz. Don’t leave us. What are friends for?” It was my turn to ignore his question.
        </p>
        <p>
            Leaving the café I started walking aimlessly in Barchi alleys. On the way, I remembered how it 
            all was when I was a kid. When my sole companion was my dream to be a tough pirate. 
            Alas, dreams are not lasting companions.
