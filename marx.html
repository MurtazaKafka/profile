            <h1>A Distorted Portrait of Karl Marx</h1>
            <p>
                Karl Marx was born in 1818. He was an influential German
                philosopher, political economist, and revolutionary organizer. While
                Marx was a student at university in Berlin, university authorities
                were expelling students for holding revolutionary ideas --- ideas 
                that were challenging to the rulers of that time. As a result, Marx
                decided he no longer wanted to aim for an academic career and
                became a political activist instead.

                He moved to Paris in 1843 and began writing papers to promote
                democracy and to end poverty. He wrote a paper which was so
                revolutionary, so challenging to the established political order,
                that it had to be smuggled back into Germany. Marx pointed out
                that throughout history the haves and have nots --- that is, the
                rich and the poor --- had fought each other for control of resources
                such as food, shelter, and money. He stressed that over time, the
                rich had won this battle, factory owners, bankers and so on, had
                become rich by exploiting --- using --- the industrial workers. The
                workers had nothing to sell but their labor and so they remained
                poor. Marx believed that workers all over the world had a lot in
                common and that one day workers would realize that without them
                --- if the rich didn’t have the poor working for them --- nothing in
                society would work. He was convinced that once the workers
                realized this, they would then form organizations, rise up, and
                overthrow the rich and powerful people in society.

                Marx and his colleague Freidrich Engels wrote down these
                ideas in the Communist Manifesto --- a book which predicted
                that one day, under a communist system, people would no longer
                be exploited and have to fight over resources. Almost immediately
                after this work was completed, revolution broke out in Europe.
                The uprisings were brutally suppressed by the rulers across Europe,
                and Marx had to escape to London where he remained in exile
                for the rest of his life. After the revolutionary wave of 1848 subsided,
                Marx turned his attention to writing a detailed analysis of what
                was wrong with capitalism, the system that, in his opinion, created
                such an unfair distribution of resources, and consequent uprisings.
                This work was Marx’s Das Kapital. Marx died before he finished
                writing Das Kapital. This was partly because he became involved
                in organizing an international workers party. I mean, he didn’t
                finish his book because he was busy organizing the International
                Workingmen’s Party.
